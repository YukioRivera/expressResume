      <h2>
         â€‹Hello, I am Yukio Rivera. I am a graduate of California State University, Monterey Bay, with an anticipated graduation date of June 2023. Additionally, I hold a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology, which I earned from the University of California, Santa Cruz in June 2015.

         The CS program offers students a chance to apply core computer science concepts to real-world challenges by engaging in project-based courses within a cutting-edge technological environment. The program emphasizes the development of collaboration, teamwork, and communication skills as crucial aspects of the learning experience.
         Students begin by taking a collection of foundational computer science courses, building a strong base of knowledge in the field. They then choose from one of four concentrations - software engineering, network and security, data science, or game development - allowing them to gain deep insights into specific areas of interest. The comprehensive curriculum encourages students to expand their expertise by exploring multiple concentrations, preparing them to become adaptable computer science professionals.
         My goal is to pursue a career in software engineering and showcase my skills through various academic projects and initiatives.

   <h3>Goal:</h3>
   <p>
      In the long term, I will continue to increase my effort to learn and obtain the latest technologies while working as a software engineer and to focus on my current and future career success in the software engineering industry. In short term I am currently completing the curriculum of the computer science online program at the California State University of Monterey Bay and will earn a bachelor's degree in computer science in June of 2023.

   <h3>CSUMB Computer Science B.S.</h3>
   <p>
      In the CS program, students learn fundamental computer science concepts while applying their knowledge to solve real-world problems. Collaboration, team work and communication skills are infused into the learning experiences with heavily project-based courses in a state-of-the-art technological environment. <br>
      Students begin by taking a set of common core courses to establish a strong foundation in computer science, followed by taking courses in the applicable concentration area. The curriculum provides students the opportunity to learn concepts and develop skills in more than one concentration.  Final major learning outcomes help them to become well rounded computer science professionals.
